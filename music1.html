            <B>The History of Music</B> is a lengthy topic which requires much depth and time. Music is an ancient art
            form that began during prehistoric times. It carries with it a history for each human culture throughout
            time. Although there are many varied definitions of music, it is a cultural universal because every culture
            throughout time and history has made music a primary component of life. For ages, music was passed down
            through oral tradition on a fundamental level; but for formal purposes, recorded music began with the
            written tradition by medieval monks during 500 AD to 1400. <br>Monks used a written number system based on
            neumes which is a predecessor for modern musical notation today. This was also the time period when
            polyphony was developed, which means the usage of multiple sounds coming together to form a melody and
            harmony. The birth of music, as it is today, truly emerged out of the Renaissance time period. In the
            sixteenth century, a time period known as the golden age, began. The art of vocal polyphony in both sacred
            and secular music began to emerge and the theories on music were formulated. Gioseffo Zarlino was the Master
            of the Chapel at St. Marks in Venice, Italy. His work on proportion in voice and music formulated a harmony
            on the whole. The idea of balance in both the world and in music gave way to writing music with balance in
            mind. The word music is derived from a word in the Greek language, "mousike" which translates to, ''art of
            the muses.''</h5>
